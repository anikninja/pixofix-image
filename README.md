## Installation

New Laravel application? make sure that your local machine has `PHP`, `Composer`, `Node`, `NPM` and the `Laravel installer` installed.

Read Doc: [Installing PHP and the Laravel Installer](https://laravel.com/docs/12.x/installation#installing-php)

### Installing PHP and the Laravel Installer

macOS installer:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/mac/8.4)"
```

Windows installer by Windows PowerShell:

```sh
# Run as administrator...
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://php.new/install/windows/8.4'))
```

Linux installer:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://php.new/install/linux/8.4)"
```


Already have PHP and Composer installed? then install the Laravel installer via Composer::

```sh
composer global require laravel/installer
```

### Installation Using Herd

I recommend to [Install Laravel Herd](https://herd.laravel.com/) for local development environment.

*Laravel Herd is considered the best for many due to its ability to simplify local development or test, providing a fast and convenient environment for building Laravel applications.*


## Clone Repository

Clone the repo locally:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/anikninja/pixofix-image.git
cd pixofix-image
```

Install PHP dependencies:

```sh

npm install && npm run build
```

Setup configuration:

```sh

Create an SQLite database. You can also use another database (MySQL, Postgres), simply update your configuration accordingly.

```sh
touch database/database.sqlite
```

Run database migrations:

```sh
php artisan migrate
```

Run database seeder:

```sh
php artisan db:seed

Run server:

*Click on following `APP_URL` in your Terminal.*

N:B: If you are using **Laravel Herd**, then you should set your Project Name: `pixofix-image`

Change the `APP_URL` value `http://pixofix-image.test` in your local `.env` file.
